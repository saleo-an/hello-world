# hello-world
Just getting started.

Hi Everyone,

I've spent the last 5 years working in community development both locally and internationally. 
I'm making a switch and am looking forward to what lays ahead.

I'm all about technology innovation in community development, AND street food. 

Cheers,
saleo-an
